✅ Clean Baseline for Voice Detection

    “Do nothing. Sit still. Keep your eyes open, stare at a fixed point. Let your mind stay empty.”

Why?

    No thinking

    No inner speech

    No physical movement

    No emotional reaction

This makes the EEG signal flat, regular, and stable — so any injected voice causes a clear disturbance.
🧪 Repeatable Procedure
Baseline Task:

    Sit in a chair, back straight

    Look at a simple black cross on a white screen or paper

    Eyes open, don’t blink too much

    Don’t think anything. Don’t move. Just observe.

Duration:

    2 minutes before recording starts

    Repeat 1-minute blocks between events

Marking:

    Press a key when baseline starts (e.g., B)

    Press a key when baseline ends (B again)

🔍 Why It Works

    You define the "normal EEG" when no voices and no thoughts are present

    Then compare it to the EEG during voice events

    Any sudden activity — spikes, entropy change, gamma burst — is meaningful



📊 Data Analysis
    Compute and compare:

        Band power (especially gamma)

        Entropy

        Sudden shifts
